# Equation Reader
The assumption of the project was to create an application enabling the recognition of simple mathematical operations from a loaded image. The program was written using MATLAB R2021b software. 

## Description of functionality 
The program was written using two MATLAB toolboxes: the Deep Learning Toolbox for training neural networks and the Image Processing Toolbox for image operations. To start using the program, you need to choose an image containing the expression of your choice. The program allows you to read it using a previously trained neural network and then indicate numeric values or draw a chart in the case of expressions with variables 'x' and 'y'. The program also allows you to train your own network and test it. Another functionality is saving the recognized expression to a .txt file.
